# Sums of Squares: Individual and Group Task

This project explores the number of ways positive integers can be written as sums of squares and extends to investigate sums of polygonal numbers.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for running the web application)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    By default, the app will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

- Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the application.

- Explore the individual and group tasks related to sums of squares and polygonal numbers.

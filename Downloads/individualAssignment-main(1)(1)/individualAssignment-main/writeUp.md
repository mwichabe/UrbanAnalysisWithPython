# Sums of Squares: Individual Task

## Task Overview
This project involves exploring the number of ways positive integers can be written as sums of squares, with a focus on the sum of two squares. The task required implementing Python code to calculate and analyze these sums.

## Implementation Details
### `app.py`:
- Contains the Flask application to serve the web page.
- Includes functions to calculate the number of ways a positive integer can be written as the sum of squares.
- Renders the results on the web page.

### `individual.html`:
- HTML template to display the results of the individual task.
- Uses Flask templating to dynamically showcase the number of ways for each positive integer.

## Results
- **Sum of Squares:**
  - Calculated the number of ways positive integers can be written as the sum of two squares.
  - Implemented Python code to automate the process.
  - Identified patterns and observed results for selected integers (3, 4, 5, 6).

## Challenges Faced
- Initial setup and installation of Flask and required dependencies.
- Ensuring accurate implementation of the number of ways calculation.

## Code Structure
- **`app.py`:**
  - `calculate_sums_of_squares(n)`: Function to calculate the number of ways a positive integer can be written as the sum of two squares.
  - `individual_task()`: Flask route to render the individual task webpage.

## Future Improvements
- Optimization of code for larger integers.
- Enhancement of the web page with additional visualization or interactive features.

## Conclusion
The individual task provided insights into the patterns of writing positive integers as sums of two squares. The implemented Python code successfully automated the calculation and showcased the results on a web page.
